was a great player when he lived at Trump Park Avenue even though he was on the juice Your documentary died many deaths You have in my opinion zero talent Obama just said was a very successful investor big mistake for Obama to admit he has less and less credibility Once again Obama fails to classify China as a currency manipulator He just helped China steal even more jobs and money from us If the can somehow beat Verlander tonight then they can still salvage the series And I will go to games so they will win I have never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke much better on Libya and Middle East problems Obama has no answer No I wasn t at the game yesterday can t go today either When I go they win I bet the terrorists in Libya used weapons we supplied them during their so called
